# Learn to Program with Java Script

So you want to learn to program? Well I will show you how to program Java Script.

## Why Java Script

Java Script or ECMA Script as it is called formally, is a small programming 
language that is virtually everywhere. Java Script started as the language
that was used in web browsers and was used to build the web. But today 
you can find Java Script on servers with node.js and on your desktop and 
phone with Electron.

Java Script is not my favorite language, there are better languages and 
technologies for certain tasks. But Java Script will make you a jack of all
trades and there is basically nothing you can not do with Java Script. 

## Lie To Children

I will employ a so called [lie to children] allot. I will tell with 
certainty something that I know is an oversimplification. I am doing this
with the aim to make understanding simpler, the same way you learn in high school
about apples falling on Newton's head and later in University about Einstein's 
relativity.

As far as possible I will mark sections with lie to children, to make sure you
know that here the rabbit holes does go deeper.
